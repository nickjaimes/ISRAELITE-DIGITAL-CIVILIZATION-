# 🔁 Civilization Preservation Algorithm  
**A Model for Long-Term Survival**

```python
def preserve_civilization(memory, disruption_event):
    if disruption_event:
        backup = archive_culture(memory)
        migrate_nodes(backup)
        maintain_core_identity(backup)
        await_future_reconstruction()
    return "Survival achieved"
